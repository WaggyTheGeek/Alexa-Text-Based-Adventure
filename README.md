# Alexa Text-Based Adventure
This is an app created for IB Computer Science HL. Compatible with Amazon Alexa-Enabled Devices, Alexa will read you the description, and you can then verbalize your commands to her.

/Documentation contains our documentation of work

/GameLogic contains a smaller project where logic for the game was prototyped and tested

/alexa-text-based-adventure currently contains a test app for Alexa, but will eventually contain the full, complete alexa app.

This project will eventually be hosted on AWS Lambda for easy integration with Alexa.
